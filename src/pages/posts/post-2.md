## What's the deal with this pic everywere?

It all began when I realized that using a piece of [fan art of Goku Black](/blog/inPostPic/chat-goku.webp) (a goated one) might not have been the best of ideas in terms of possible fair use and personal branding.

It was then that I decided to reach out to _my dear_ friend **Smony**, the guy behind different works of art in my projects! 
Simone created the previous pic (the one of Goku Black) that I used for over a year as my propic for github and telegram. 
Back in April, he realized the polyhedral dice art for my [tossdice](https://tossdice.pages.dev) webapp (that unfortunately does not work well as of dec 25 because I have to migrate it to a full frontend app). 

### All fun and games but who the heck is Smony?
Smony is a talented artist, currently attending his Bachelor of Arts in Comics and Illustration at Accademia di Belle Arti, L’Aquila. He is focused on Comic Book Art and Professional Illustration and at time of writing he is **ACCEPTING COMMISSIONS**

### Would you like a sample of what he can do? 
Here is one of my favourites!

### Now let's speak straight facts, do you mind?
Simone is a firm advocate of human art against the abuse of that _sloppery slop_ "AI art". His stance does not come
unmotivated. Besides the obvious negative impact that AI Slop spreadout has had on human artists, that usage of AI is a matter of concern for countless reasons. One above all - **if shortage of ram was not enough for you!** - negative climatic impact. 

### I believe it is important to address the elephant in the room
In this world of ours is kinda difficult to discern between good and evil, innit? \
\
AI can be a good tool, an assistance in certain - tedious - tasks. But it should never substitute human work in terms of creativity. As an example I do like AI assisted coding as far as I don't feel too biased toward a design pattern or something like that. 

### The elephants may actually be two
Although it is not an easy task to distinguish good from bad, it is absolutely certain that companies are abusing AI Slop cause it costs less than paying artists. But AI Slop is soulless, it would be fun to create memes with if only does not waste this much energy. I can condone the use of it as inspirational model, a mockup tool or as a corrective tool on Graphic Design and Illustration programs, but I believe that **art belongs to artists**.

### I'd like to commission an illustration to Smony
You can reach out to him on Telegram @**SpazioUomo**.
