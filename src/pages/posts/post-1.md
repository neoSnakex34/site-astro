## some context
This blog has been built with the idea of keeping my site alive for a little bit more than the last one.

### the last one?
For those who may not know, I built two portfolio sites in the past years. The first was built with nuxt.js and the second was a pure react experiment with daisyui and tailwind. Both of them failed.  
The first lacked style and usability, the second was just not catchy enough. 
Nonetheless, some ideas from the react site were reused in this site. For instance:
- the formatting of the skill page has been copy-pasted from the previous one and then adapted to the new ui/ux needs.
- the code mockup with the fake ``` whoami ``` command was already present in the old site.

### srsly? a blog in the great 2025?
I mean, even though I'm a supporter of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory" rel="noopener noreferrer">dead internet theory</a> I still believe that internet used to be quite of a place.  
Being a gen-z means I grew up on mid 2000s and 10s internet. 
- I've witnessed the birth of countless memes
- I made friends on skype and was an old facebook fan
- I played LoL when it was still an enjoyable game (kind of)
- I even had a blog when I was a kid, it was a mockup of my uncle blog and it was hosted on altervista and the bloog (when altervista closed).
  
_That_ Internet was a place **for human beings**, and I believe that keeping that old fashioned world wide web alive should be everyone's mission.

### wasn't this site a portfolio?
It is, kind of.  
It has a section for my skills, my projects, and some presentation about me. It is structured like a personal work portfolio/resumee, but I'd like to see it more as a personal - general purpose - site for the reason above.

### do you use any AI in those posts?
I do not, some parts of the site are coded using AI assistance (_no vibecoding_) but my posts are written by me. The only thing I may occasionally do is double check some phrases with gpt to make sure the spelling or the syntax is right. 

### conclusions 
If you read this till now, **welcome to my blog!**  
in the future you may find new posts [here](/blog)
